 * \class CUpwScalar
 * \brief Template class for scalar upwind fluxes between nodes i and j.
 * \details This class serves as a template for the scalar upwinding residual
 *   classes.  The general structure of a scalar upwinding calculation is the
 *   same for many different  models, which leads to a lot of repeated code.
 *   By using the template design pattern, these sections of repeated code are
 *   moved to this shared base class, and the specifics of each model
 *   are implemented by derived classes.  In order to add a new residual
 *   calculation for a convection residual, extend this class and implement
 *   the pure virtual functions with model-specific behavior.
